## Getting Ready

Before you can contribute to a package, you need to get your system setup for development.

1. If it's been a while since you updated R/RStudio, take the time to update now.

1. Install and configure git (if you haven't already). https://github.mskcc.org/pages/datadojo/mskRutils/articles/git_config.html#git-setup

1. Configure your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT). Remember that Enterprise GitHub and public GitHub require two different PATs. Details here https://github.mskcc.org/pages/datadojo/mskRutils/articles/git_config.html#pat

1. Install the following packages

  ```r
  install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr", "styler"))
  ```

1. Using Windows? Install RTools. https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

1. Using macOS? Install Xcode.

  ```shell
  xcode-select --install
  ```

## Write a Function
  
1. If you're adding a new function to a package, the code for the function will generally live in its own `.R` file by the same name. Run `usethis::use_r("foo")` and a blank script file will be added to the R folder. 
  
  ```r
  usethis::use_r("foo")
  #> √ Setting active project to 'C:/Users/SjobergD/GitHub/contributing-to-an-R-pkg'
  #> √ Creating 'R/'
  #> * Modify 'R/foo.R'
  #> * Call `use_test()` to create a matching test file
  ```
  
1. Write your function!

  ```r
  foo <- function(x) {
    # check input is numeric
    stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
    
    # return the mean
    mean(x)
  }
  ```
  
1. When writing function that utilize {tidyverse} functions, be sure to use the `.data` and `.env` prefixes. Review these slides for details [https://mskcc-epi-bio.github.io/Writing-Function-with-the-tidyverse/](https://mskcc-epi-bio.github.io/Writing-Function-with-the-tidyverse/)
