## Anatomy of an R Package

```{r, echo = FALSE}
fs::dir_tree(here::here("toy.pkg"))
```

## DESCRIPTION

.pull-left[
* Every package must have a `DESCRIPTION`.

* The job of the `DESCRIPTION` file is to store important metadata about your package.

  - list dependencies
  - package title/description
  - package version
  - specify the package license
  - list package authors and contributors
  
* This file is setup by the package maintainer, and you will likely _NOT_ need to modfiy this file.

* Read more here https://r-pkgs.org/description.html

.pull-right[
```

## NAMESPACE

.pull-left[

* You can see that the `NAMESPACE` file looks a bit like R code. Each line contains a directive: `S3method()`, `export()`, `importFrom()`, and so on. 

* Each directive describes an R object, and says whether it’s exported from this package to be used by others, or it’s imported from another package to be used locally.

* {roxygen2} will generate `NAMESPACE` for you! Do _not_ edit this file.

# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand
S3method(add_n,tbl_summary)
export(tbl_regression)
export(tbl_summary)
export(tbl_uvregression)
importFrom(glue,glue)
importFrom(knitr,knit_print)
importFrom(magrittr,"%>%")
