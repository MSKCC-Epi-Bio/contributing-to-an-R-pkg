## Pull Request Checklist

Most package repositories for the Epi/Biostat Dept have a pull request checklist. 
Be sure to review each item of the checklist before asking the package maintainer to review your pull request.

Example from {gtsummary}

- [ ] Ensure all package dependencies are installed by running `renv::install()`
- [ ] PR branch has pulled the most recent updates from master branch. Ensure the pull request branch and your local version match and both have the latest updates from the master branch.
- [ ] If an update was made to `tbl_summary()`, was the same change implemented for `tbl_svysummary()`?
- [ ] If a new function was added, function included in `_pkgdown.yml`
- [ ] If a bug was fixed, a unit test was added for the bug check
- [ ] Run `pkgdown::build_site()`. Check the R console for errors, and review the rendered website.
- [ ] Code coverage is suitable for any new functions/features. Review coverage with `withr::with_envvar(new = c("NOT_CRAN" = "true"), covr::report())`. Begin in a fresh R session without any packages loaded. 
- [ ] R CMD Check runs without errors, warnings, and notes
- [ ] `usethis::use_spell_check()` runs with no spelling errors in documentation
